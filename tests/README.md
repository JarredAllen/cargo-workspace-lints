Tests
---

This directory contains test cases for this code. Test cases:
* `passing-workspace` is a minimal passing workspace (one crate).
* `failing-workspace` is a minimal failing workspace (one crate).

`test.rs` runs each workspace as a test case and ensures the binary passes or fails as desired.
